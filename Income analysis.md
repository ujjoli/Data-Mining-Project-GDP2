# Income Analysis

After analyzing GDP by state, lets analyze Income of each state and by different areas to see some patterns. First of all, lets see how the income is varied by state to state.
So lets compare the income of all 50 states for many yeaars and come back to 2019. 

We are comparing personal income by state so Lets see the plot. The plot shows that over time the personal income has been increasing in all states and people are being able to 
bring more paycheck home

This plot just gives the idea of how the income is varied by state to state. To have deeper sense, we are acutually going to see the income by different areas, solet's look bar plot.

This plot compares the income made by each state on basis of wages and salaries. In other words, this plot shows those people whose income is earned from typical wages and salaries,
and compares it to top 10 states. Even in this plot you see California has higher personal income than other states in terms of wages and salaries. Having said that it is important
to remember that Califronia had Real state area to generate its top industry. California is followed by Texas New York and Florida.

Now, lets analyze other area which is retail trade. So on the retail trade too, you will see California dominating all other states followed by Texas and New York

Now comparing manufacturing area, you will see the same pattern where California stays at the top

Similarly, even if you compare in transport area, you will see similar pattern, but you can notice the difference between states have been reduced for trasnportation area

Now another area we would like to see is information. The following plot shows that California dominates all other states and the disparity between the states rises.

Similarly, same pattern goes for real estate. Not only in GDP, even in personal income the California is top of the all.

Moreover, even for the accomodation and food service area, personal income of California is higher than other states.

Finally,we have government area, and this area also follows the same pattern like other areas.

So from all these comparisons, we can say that from all the areas, California residents bring back more paychaecks than any other states and are more tend to have economic well being.


With all these analysis, we can move forward to analysis of expenditure and see their consumption pattern. Along with it we can compare income with the consumption.

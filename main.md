# Income, Inflation, Expenditure Analysis by US States

Welcome all !! The purpose of this analysis is to see how US, states of US is doing with it GDP, income and expenditure. This analysis finds some insights about
inflation, spending behavior of states and residents. 

*P.S. the data needed for this project is taken from [BEA's Websitre](https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm)**. Also, while computing the filter and analysis 
for this project, I have compared 50 states and Disctrict of Colombia (DC)

As expected, to accomplish the analysis, I have gone through several steps:

#### 1. Importing packages
While importing packages, I have imported many library and packages with it.
#### 2. Importing files
#### 3, Filtering data
#### 4. Visualization and Analysis
  
  For ease of visualization and analysis, I have divided the analysis part into 5 categories:
  1. Analysis of GDP
  2. Aanalysis of Price
  3. Analysis of Personal expenditure and Inflation
  4. Analysis of Relative Cost and living
  5. Co-relation between GDP and Relative Cost and living
